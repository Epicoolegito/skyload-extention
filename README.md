# skyload-extention
I saw that not a lot of people knew that you can just manually install extensions using developer mode in Brave, Chrome, and Opera. 
Just download the compressed zip file first.
Open your browser and go to the settings, then the extentions page. (for chrome its chrome://extensions/)
Tap on the developer mode switch and drag the downloaded skyload zip to that page. (extentions page with developer mode turned on)
Your welcome.
